# Using React with Bootstrap (react-bootstrap)
This React app generates a simple quiz based on user's Spotify playlists. It features connecting to Spotify Web API, accessing provided data, extracting useful information from that data and generating multiple choice questions. This app demonstrates an extensive usage of React features. Almost every component in the master branch has explanations and component flow information.
